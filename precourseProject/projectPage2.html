        <p class = "pd">
          nobody can tell for sure where they are going in life.  I honestly believe anywhere I end up if i'm developing code on something I will be happy.  I wish to continue travelling throughout my life, I wish to have time to golf in the future.  I wish to be inspired to code something that will make peoples lives easier.
